# Data Structures Practical Assignment

This project is part of a practical assignment for the **Data Structures (ED)** course. The goal of this work is to explore and understand the main sorting algorithms, including quadratic algorithms with time complexity **O(nÂ²)**, sublinear algorithms with time complexity **O(n log n)**, and linear algorithms with time complexity **O(n)**.

We aim to analyze and experiment with these sorting methods under different workloads to compare their performance and efficiency. The project involves running experimental tests on various datasets to observe how each algorithm behaves as input sizes and data patterns vary.
